# PC04 Generative Art & Tools for the week
This week, we'll be working on for loops and randomness to create Generative Art! We'll also spend a lot of time reviewing and practicing coding together!
We'll also start borrowing code from The Internet. Read the [rules](https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/75648/pages/rules-on-borrowing-code) so you don't lose points.

## In this repo
1. Practice code for working on for loops. This file is a **Jupyter notebook** file. (Download, expand file, move folder to ATLS 1300 folder, open Jupyter Notebook, navigate to folder, open file. Phew!)
2. Start code for working on codei n class and for PC04
3. Example code - demonstrates 1) how to create multiple turtles, 2) how to use some random functions

For this assignment, you'll be making generative art--animations or drawings that have a random element. These can be colors, sizes of shapes or lines, positions, direction a turtle faces--anything! [Generative art](https://classroom.github.com/a/kHZjV2_U) is an artistic piece that has a consistent theme with small aspects that vary randomly each time the program is run. This can be the position of a shape or pattern, color, size...any element that you can change in the turtle features.

You will be using the `random library` for this assignment. Please take some time to read about key functions in the library. There is a digest in the [assignment on Canvas.](https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/75648/assignments/1106664) 

**As always, use the docs!**<br>
You can access the docs in the Resource Module ([Documentation Links](https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/75648/modules/items/3014169)).<br>
Use the [turtle documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) to look at examples of how you can make different patterns and use different colors.

## WORK SMART! ##
- Always start with pseudocode (it's required)! What do you want to do? What information/functions do you need to do it? In what order?
- Use your pseudocode from PC03 (spirographs are welcome)
- Make sure you've met the assignment requirements!
- If you're feeling behind or overwhelmed, you can edit your PC03 assignment and focus on the NEW CONCEPTS instead of the creative aspect. You will likely get the same creative score as your PC03 grade (feel free to ask your LA for that grade if it's not released yet).


# PC04 - The Assignment

Create a piece of generative art. Make the artwork aesthetically and conceptually interesting. What do you want the user of your program to experience?

## Tech requirements

Your code should use:
- a **short description** of your art at the top of the script (around line 6 of the start code)
- ~~a pattern generated from **another student's pseudocode** (a "pseudo pattern")~~ **NOW EXTRA CREDIT!**
- at least **two (2) for loops**, with a **comment** describing what the loop does (E.C. for loop in pseudo pattern counts!)
- at least **two (2) Turtle variables** (i.e., give 2 turtles names that describe what they do) (E.C. turtle created in pseudo pattern counts!)
- one (1) implementation of the `random.random()`, `random.randint()`, or `random.choice()` functions 
    (`import random` is in the start code, to help you access these functions.)
- **comments** to describe what is randomized and why (ex: `# used randint to put the turtle in a random horizonal position, -100 < x < 100`)

If you borrow code from the internet, please cite it with a comment ABOVE the code. A comment example is below:

` # modified from [PASTE URL HERE]`

### You may not submit code that's more than 20% borrowed code (by # of lines)

## Submit:
1. Pseudocode (sketches included) is due by the end of recitation! Late submissions of pseudocode results in 1 pt off the assignment.
2. (Borrowed pseudocode does not have to be submitted. Code you build from that pseudocode should be commented with student name.)<br>
`#built from NAME's pseudocode`<br>
`# enter code below`
3. your script (.py) and any images you use in your script (.gif) should be submitted through Github Classrooms.
    Name your script: **PC04_GenArt.py**
### Extra credit:
1 pt - incorporate a pattern generated from **[another student's pseudocode](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TOcGo8msaZ1wEbiz75ABsVrHypVciL5w?usp=sharing)** (a "pseudo pattern")

**Team Submissions (optional):** There should be 1 pseudocode file and 1 file for both people in the team! (ex. Marlo & Kingston are working together. Marlo's repo has 1 pseudocode file and 1 script (.py), Kingston's repo...same deal.)
